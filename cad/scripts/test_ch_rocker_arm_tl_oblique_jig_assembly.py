"""Offline contract for the oblique-trammel jig assembly (MHA-CH-06-TL-00).

The poses close on the calculator's rail and carrier geometry and the leadscrew
feed's layout, the builder places all thirty-one made and bought families,
one free DOF slides the carriages and what rides them, the interference
contracts are the specs' press fits and threads, the jig stays a shop fixture
outside the machine tree, and the sweep of both passes clears the table and
the column cover by the pinned margins.
