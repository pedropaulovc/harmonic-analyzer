r"""Summing-lever dimensional contract -- the single source of truth shared by
the part build (``build_summing_lever.py``) and its manufacturing drawing
(``draw_summing_lever.py``).

PURE DATA, no SolidWorks/COM imports (``stock_anchor_geom`` is pure geometry).
A large green-iron casting: a coefficients plate carrying the 20 channel-spring
anchor taps on the +X arm, a solid pivot cylinder with hex knife-edge
trunnions, and a curved summation arm ending in the tapped counter-spring
anchor boss on the -X arm.  Both anchors are purchased eyebolts that thread
straight into those taps -- the lever IS their nut -- so this module owns the
two thread identities and the boss height, and no plain anchor bore exists.
Values MUST match build_summing_lever.py.
