# Developing — local workflow notes

Practical, machine-local development notes that don't belong in `AGENTS.md`
(orientation) or the per-topic policy docs. Right now: the remote build cache.

## Remote build-artifact cache

The COM/SolidWorks tasks (`part:<stem>`, `assembly:<stem>`, `drawing:<stem>`) are
the slow part of the pipeline — a part is ~20 s and a full assembly ~500 s. Their
outputs are a pure
function of their hashed inputs, so a shared cache lets one machine **download a
prebuilt `.SLDPRT`/`.SLDASM`/`.SLDDRW`/`.STL`/`.PDF`** for an unchanged input set
instead of
driving SolidWorks. A seat-less machine can pull; a builder pulls **and**
publishes. Implementation: `cad/scripts/_artifact_cache.py`.

### TL;DR — it just works

Both dev seats are pre-authorized and the default role is `rw`, so **a clean
checkout needs zero setup**: it pulls what the other seat built and publishes
what it builds. You only touch anything to *opt out* or to bust the cache after a
SolidWorks upgrade.

### How keys work

Each task is keyed by a SHA-256 of its `file_dep` set, folded **exactly** like
doit's staleness check (`ContentChecker._digest`: raw bytes for binaries,
parsed-YAML for configs), so a cache hit and "doit up-to-date" always agree and a
comment-only YAML edit busts neither. Paths are tagged **repo-relative**, so the
key is identical across machines and worktrees.

The `file_dep` set for a COM task also folds the **`SolidworksMCP-python`
submodule** — the vendored COM adapter (`solidworks_mcp`) is imported at runtime
by `_common`/`_assembly` (mate/plane/feature creation), so its source is a genuine
build input, yet it is an installed package, not a repo-local `_*.py` helper, so
`module_deps_of` never walked it (issue #144). `dodo._submodule_dep()` folds a
content-hash of the submodule's `src/solidworks_mcp` tree (repo-relative-tagged,
so cross-machine-stable) in as **one synthetic dep** — a small gitignored
`cad/out/reports/.solidworks-mcp-submodule.digest` sidecar whose content is that
hash — added only in the COM dep builders (`_part_file_deps` / `_recipe_files`), so
a submodule bump (committed pin **or** a dirty local edit) busts every COM key and
forces a rebuild, while the SolidWorks-free `check:*` tasks stay off it. Guarded by
`check:recipe` (`test_dodo_recipe.py`). *Migration:* this shifts every COM cache
key once — the build self-heals over one run (a rebuild re-stamps the ledger and
republishes), or run `doit reset-dep`.

Private/experimental work is cached too, with no namespacing: a unique input set
yields a unique key, so an experiment is stored under its own key and never
collides with the canonical artefacts. Two seats share a blob only when their
inputs are byte-identical.

### Debugging a miss (provenance & diagnostics)

A key is `sha256(epoch + salt + Σ(relpath, digest))`, so an unexpected key shift
is almost always **one dep digest moving**. Three best-effort tools surface that
without reconstructing build history from terminal scrollback (none can fail a
build):

- **`doit cache_status`** — the one-command answer to *"why did this miss?"*. For
  every part/assembly/drawing it prints `HIT`/`MISS` (a backend presence probe — a
  HEAD,
  not a download) + the 12-char key, and for a miss the full `(digest, relpath)`
  list that produced the key. Compare two seats' output and the moved digest is the
  culprit. Args after `--`:
  - label substrings to filter — `doit cache_status -- cone_gear`
  - `miss` — only the misses
  - `all` — dump dep digests for **every** task, not just misses
  - a `DRIFT(last published …)` flag appears when a task's current key differs from
    the last key *this seat* published (see below).
- **`HARMONIC_CACHE_DEBUG=1`** — during a real `doit` build, logs each
  `(digest, relpath)` feeding every key and the resulting key, tagged by task. Turn
  it on for the build you're diagnosing rather than reasoning after the fact.
- **`cad/out/reports/cache.jsonl`** — an append-only event log (one JSON object per
  restore/store: `ts`, `event`, `label`, `key`, `epoch`, `salt`). Events:
  `store` / `store_skip` (ro seat) / `store_empty` / `store_error`,
  `restore_hit` / `restore_miss` / `restore_hit_drift` / `restore_error`. Post-hoc
  debugging reads this file instead of scrollback. Gitignored (under `cad/out/`).

**Store-skip-on-hit drift.** `restore` returns early on a HIT and never re-stores,
so a seat can *serve* a key it never *published* (this is what bit the v0.9.0 cut:
key shifts across refactor waves meant the final key was never written for 22 of 73
parts, even though every one had a valid on-disk SLDPRT). To surface it, each
successful `store` stamps `cad/out/reports/cache-keys/<label>.key` with the key this
seat published; on a later HIT under a *different* key, `restore` logs a `WARN` and
a `restore_hit_drift` event — and `cache_status` shows the `DRIFT(...)` flag.

### Backend: Azure Blob over HTTPS (443)

One content-addressed `<key>.tar.gz` blob per task in container `buildcache` on
storage account `stswbuildcache07aba2`. Reached over **443** — works from any
network, including ISPs that block SMB/445 (e.g. Comcast), with no VPN or mounted
drive. Auth is **keyless** via `DefaultAzureCredential`:

- **dev box** → your `az login` token. Run `az login` once.
- **builder (`vm-solidworks`)** → its system-assigned managed identity
  (granted *Storage Blob Data Contributor*); nothing to log in.

A machine without the data-plane RBAC role is **fail-soft**: its push is denied
and the build proceeds normally (a miss/error never fails a build).

### Roles and how to set them

Role is one of `off` | `ro` (pull only) | `rw` (pull + push). Resolved in order:

1. `HARMONIC_REMOTE_CACHE_MODE` env var, if set
2. `.harmonic-remote-cache-mode` — a **gitignored one-line file at the repo root**
   (`C:\src\harmonic-analyzer\.harmonic-remote-cache-mode`), contents just `off`/`ro`/`rw`
3. `_DEFAULT_MODE` = **`rw`** (the fallback)

`.harmonic-remote-cache-mode` is **per-clone** (not global) and never committed. To
downgrade a seat — e.g. a collaborator without Azure access — drop the file at the
repo root:

```powershell
Set-Content .harmonic-remote-cache-mode off    # disable (no pull, no push)
Set-Content .harmonic-remote-cache-mode ro     # pull only
```

Or, equivalently, without a file: `$env:HARMONIC_REMOTE_CACHE_MODE = 'off'`.

Check the resolved role:

```powershell
uv run python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'cad/scripts'); import _artifact_cache as c; print(c._mode())"
```

### Defaults you can override

Account, container, and salt are committed constants in `_artifact_cache.py`
(`_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`, `_DEFAULT_CONTAINER`, `_DEFAULT_SALT`). Each is overridable by
its matching `HARMONIC_CACHE_*` env var (CI, tests, an unlanded salt bump). None
is a secret — the account is RBAC-gated with public blob access off.

### Busting the cache (salt / epoch)

The toolchain (SolidWorks major version, COM adapter) is **not** in any
`file_dep`, so a SW upgrade that changes geometry would otherwise serve a stale
hit. Mix-ins guard this:

- **`_DEFAULT_SALT`** (e.g. `sw2024-sp3`) — bump it in the **same commit** that
  adapts to a new SolidWorks version, so the cache busts in lockstep with the
  code. All seats must agree on the salt or they never share hits.
- **`_CACHE_EPOCH`** — bump to invalidate *every* entry pipeline-wide (e.g. a
  pack-format change).

### Retention — server-side, no job

Account **last-access-time tracking** + a lifecycle rule
`delete daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan: 7`. A restore is a blob *read*, which
bumps last-access, so an artefact in active use keeps itself alive (true LRU). No
scheduled cleanup task, no client-side touch.

### Provisioning (one-time, operator)

`scripts/azure/provision_build_cache.ps1` is idempotent and does everything:
creates the container, enables last-access tracking, sets the lifecycle policy,
and grants `Storage Blob Data Contributor` to the signed-in operator and the
`vm-solidworks` managed identity. Run it once with `az` logged into the Dev/Test
subscription.

### Caveats

- The `rw` default means *any* clone attempts a push. Safe (RBAC denies an
  unauthorized seat, fail-soft), but an unauthorized seat pays a credential-probe
  delay per build — set `.harmonic-remote-cache-mode off` there.
- Cross-machine hit rate depends on identical input **bytes**. Without a
  `.gitattributes` normalizing line endings, a `.py` re-materialized with
  different EOLs hashes differently → a miss (never a wrong artefact). Add
  `*.py text eol=lf` if hit rate disappoints.
