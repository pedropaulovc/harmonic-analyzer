# Michelson Harmonic Analyzer (Recreation Project)

This repository documents the full reconstruction of Albert A. Michelson‚Äôs 20-element harmonic analyzer‚Äîan analog mechanical computer that performs Fourier synthesis and analysis via a system of gears, springs, levers, and cams.

## üìê Project Scope

This is a high-fidelity, didactic recreation of the original machine described in:

- *Albert Michelson‚Äôs Harmonic Analyzer: A Visual Tour of a Nineteenth Century Machine that Performs Fourier Analysis* by Bill Hammack, Steve Kranz, and Bruce Carpenter.
- EngineerGuy YouTube video series: ["A Machine That Uses Gears to Add Sines and Cosines"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2FF649D0C4407B30)

The project is designed as an advanced, hands-on learning experience in mechanical engineering, digital fabrication, and precision machining.

## üß© Components

The analyzer is composed of 20 mechanical channels operating in parallel, each contributing one sinusoidal term. Key subsystems include:

- Crank and translational gearing
- Cone gear set (variable frequency generation)
- Cylinder gear set (frequency transmission)
- Rocker arms and amplitude bars
- Summing lever and spring systems
- Magnifying and pen mechanism
- Platen (paper transport)

See `docs/components/` for engineering drawings and CAD assemblies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

The implementation follows a structured seven-phase process:

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Research & Documentation | 2 weeks | Study source materials, identify mechanical principles |
| 2. Preliminary Design        | 3 weeks | Create core CAD assemblies of gears, linkages |
| 3. Detailed CAD Modeling     | 4 weeks | Full-featured models with tolerances and annotations |
| 4. Manufacturing             | 6 weeks | CNC machining, lathe work, and parts procurement |
| 5. Assembly & Calibration    | 4 weeks | Physical build-up and iterative tuning |
| 6. Testing & Validation      | 3 weeks | Compare machine output with known Fourier series |
| 7. Publication               | 2 weeks | Prepare final documentation and make it open-source |
