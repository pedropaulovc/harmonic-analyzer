Orientation for coding agents. Pairs with `docs/pipeline/` (flow diagrams + the
refactor plan).

## Clone with submodules

This repo has submodules (e.g. `references`). Always clone recursively so they
are pulled in:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules <repo-url>
```

Already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`? Initialize them in place:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Every new session (do this first)

1. Invoke `/developing-solidworks` first (see the note at the top of this file).
2. Python tooling: always use `uv`.

## Initialize the project (uv)

This repo is a **uv project** (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock` at the root). One
command builds the environment from the lockfile — no manual `pip install`:

```
git submodule update --init   # fetch ./SolidworksMCP-python (the COM adapter, branch `personal`)
uv sync                       # core deps + the dev group (pytest) — everything the pipeline needs
```

`uv sync` creates `.venv/` (gitignored) and installs everything pinned in
`uv.lock`: `doit`, `pyyaml`, `pillow`, `numpy`, `trimesh`, `matplotlib`,
`pytest`, plus the Windows COM bindings (`pywin32`, `comtypes`) and the
**`solidworks-mcp-python`** package — wired in as an *editable path source*
(`[tool.uv.sources]` → `./SolidworksMCP-python`), since `verify.py` /
`_common.py` / `_assembly.py` all `from solidworks_mcp …`. That package is
vendored as a **git submodule** (tracking branch `personal`), so
`git submodule update --init` must run before the first `uv sync`. After editing
`pyproject.toml`, re-run `uv sync`; commit `pyproject.toml` **and** `uv.lock`
(never `.venv/`).

## SolidWorks is the source of truth — CadQuery is local-only

This codebase builds its CAD **primarily with SolidWorks** via the COM API; the
SolidWorks parts/assemblies are the only artefacts that ship. When a SolidWorks
seat isn't available, you MAY use **CadQuery** as a head-less stand-in to
prototype or eyeball a part's geometry — but **for local development ONLY**.

**No CadQuery code may be merged.** Keep stand-ins out of commits and PRs; the
SolidWorks build script stays the single tracked source for every part. (Any
CadQuery file that lands on a branch must be removed before merge.)

## The pipeline is one doit graph

`dodo.py` (repo root) drives the **whole** pipeline: build → verify → export →
release. There is no separate orchestrator and no hand-run scripts for the happy
path — every stage is a doit task. Run it through uv (SolidWorks already open for
the COM tasks):

```
uv run python -m doit             # = `build`: everything + every gate
uv run python -m doit -n 4        # same, check:* fanned out in parallel
uv run python -m doit build_bare  # quick: parts + assemblies only
uv run python -m doit check:math  # one SolidWorks-free gate (no SW needed)
```

The SolidWorks-free `check:*` gates and the comparison/diff tooling run from this
`.venv` with nothing else installed; the COM tasks (`part:`/`assembly:`/
`verify:*`/`export`/`release`) additionally need SolidWorks open on this machine.

## Task groups — the prefix tells you if SolidWorks is needed

| group | needs SolidWorks | on the COM spine |
|-------|:---:|:---:|
| `part:<stem>`, `assembly:<stem>` | yes | yes |
| `verify:soundness`, `verify:subsystems`, `verify:kinematics` | yes | yes |
| `export`, `release` | yes | yes |
| `check:math`, `check:config`, `check:graph`, `check:nameplate`, `check:recipe` | **no** | no (parallel) |
| `build` (default), `build_bare` | meta | — |

- `build` is the **one** fully-safe entry: every part + assembly + every gate.
  (`verify.py` has no `--suite all` anymore — `build` replaced it.)
- `build_bare` = parts + assemblies only (fast, no gates, no export).
- `release` is opt-in: `doit release -- v0.2.0 [--draft]`.

## The COM spine (do not break this)

One SolidWorks STA seat ⇒ COM tasks must never run concurrently. Instead of
forbidding `-n`, `dodo.py` chains every COM task into a single linear `task_dep`
**spine** (`_COM_TAIL` + `_spine_dep` in `dodo.py`), a topological linearization
of the COM sub-DAG:

```
part:a → … → assembly:harmonic_analyzer → verify:soundness → verify:subsystems
        → verify:kinematics → export → release
```

So at most one COM task is ever *ready* — the seat is never contended **even
under `-n N`** — while `check:*` tasks (off the spine) run in parallel. Corollary:
never launch two SolidWorks build scripts by hand at once.

**Invariant:** any new COM-touching task MUST be inserted into the spine
(extend `_COM_TAIL` / the spine order and give it `_spine_dep(...)`). A gap lets
two COM tasks run at once and deadlocks the seat. `_assert_spine_complete()` is a
tripwire, not a full proof — think before you add. The SolidWorks-free tasks must
**not** be on the spine, or you lose the parallelism.

Tradeoff (documented, accepted): a COM failure mid-spine skips the later COM
tasks in that run. Fix and re-run; doit re-runs only what is still stale.

## Incremental rebuilds — refresh vs full

doit hashes script + config **content** (immune to git/worktree mtime churn) and
propagates a part → assembly DAG. When only a part changed, the dependent
assembly is *refreshed* — reopen + per-config `ForceRebuild3` + health/DOF/
interference gates + in-place `Save3` (seconds) — instead of a from-scratch
re-insert/re-mate (~500 s). It escalates to a *full* rebuild (+ any post-assembly
hooks) when the assembly script / `_common.py` / a hook changed, or the target is
missing. Force a full rebuild of one assembly by deleting its `.SLDASM` target,
then `doit assembly:<stem>`.

**Fail loud.** A refresh that hits a dangling mate, free DOF, or interference
exits non-zero and leaves the `.SLDASM` untouched — never a stale artefact.

## Remote build cache (cross-machine)

The cross-machine extension of the above: COM tasks are keyed by their
`file_dep` content hash and their outputs are pulled from / published to a shared
**Azure Blob** cache (over 443) instead of rebuilt on the SolidWorks seat.
Default role is `rw` — a clean checkout on an authorized seat pulls and publishes
with **zero setup**. Set/override a seat's role with `HARMONIC_CACHE_MODE` or a
gitignored `.harmonic-cache-mode` file at the repo root (`off`/`ro`/`rw`). Full
details — roles, auth, salt-busting, provisioning, caveats — in
[`DEVELOPING.md`](DEVELOPING.md).

## Fine-grained config deps

Each part/assembly depends on ONLY the `cad/config` files it actually reads,
derived by static analysis of its `_config.<accessor>` calls (`config_files_of`
in `_buildgraph.py`); `dodo.py` honors it as the file_dep + assembly-recipe set.
The config is split per-subsystem (`cad/config/machine/<subsystem>.yaml` +
`_base.yaml`) and per-part (`cad/config/parts/<dashed-name>.yaml` +
`_defaults.yaml`); `_config._doc` re-aggregates them transparently, so
accessors/verify/provenance are unchanged. Net: editing one part's registry row
rebuilds only that part; a `machine channels.active_count` edit (in
`machine/channels.yaml`) skips the gear parts (they read `machine/gear_train.yaml`);
the narrative `dimensions.yaml` (read by no part) rebuilds nothing. It is
CONSERVATIVE — any `_config` use the analyzer can't classify falls back to the
whole config — so it can only over-rebuild, never skip a real change. Don't add a
new `_config` accessor without mapping it in `_buildgraph` (`check:graph`'s
coverage test fails loud otherwise).

## Verify suites (renamed)

`verify.py --suite <x>` where `<x>` ∈ {`soundness`, `subsystems`, `kinematics`,
`math`, `config`}. `math`/`config` need no SolidWorks (wrapped as `check:*`); the
other three open the model (wrapped as `verify:*`). Old names static/isolation/
motion/truth and the `all` aggregate are gone.

## Stamps & incrementality

Gates produce no CAD artefact, so each writes a stamp under `cad/out/reports/`
(`verify-*.ok` / `check-*.ok`) as its doit target — re-runs only when a `file_dep`
changes. `cad/out/` is gitignored.

## Release-diff parallelism

`comparisons/tools/render_diff.py` (the SolidWorks-free diff `cut_release` runs)
parallelizes its per-mesh Hausdorff classification across a process pool
(`--jobs`, default auto). `cut_release` benefits with no change. `--jobs 1`
forces serial (debugging / a fallback if the spawn-mode pool misbehaves).

## Considered but NOT done (with reasons)

- **`transcode:<stem>` — dropped.** The build writes PNGs via a single COM
  `export_image()` call (`_common.save_part_and_images`); there is no separable
  Pillow/BMP step in the build path to move off the seat, so there is nothing to
  parallelize. (BMP→Pillow transcode exists only in `cut_release._export_pngs`,
  inside the already-serial release job — not worth extracting.)
- **`diff:<stem>` per-part doit fan-out — not a fit.** `render_diff` renders the
  *whole* assembly in 4 views, not per-part images; the expensive, parallelizable
  work is the Hausdorff loop, which is now parallelized inside the script (above)
  rather than as separate doit tasks.
